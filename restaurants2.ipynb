I had visited for dinner and here's my review:1) Ambience: 3.5/5-- Always crowded. Has a capacity to accomodate around 50 pax at any given point of time. Once has to pay at the counter first before getting into the restaurant. If one is lucky enough, seats may be available without much of a wait. Its an AC restaurant.\\xa02) Food : 3.5/5--- The thali is a mix of vegetables, rotis, sweet,salad,dal, khicdi/rice,chaas.People who are health conscious may want to skip this...read more\",\n",
